## What I Do

I'm a software engineer that specializes in embedded systems and low-level operating system internals.
Specifically, I enjoy reverse engineering and vulnerability analysis - knowing how software and hardware work at a fundamental level and understanding why and how things can break.

I develop primarily for:
* [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos)
* [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/)
* [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows)

When I do develop software, it's typically in:
* [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)
* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com)
* [Java](https://www.java.com/)

When I have time to play around, I reall like exploring function programming languages:
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
* [StandardML](https://www.smlnj.org/)
* [Scheme](https://www.scheme.com/)
