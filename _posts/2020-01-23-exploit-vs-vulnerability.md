# Exploit vs Vulnerability
Cybersecurity is vast and broad. The field itself stretches to every facet of
modern life - from the web browser you are using to view this page to the extremely
secure systems used by financial institutions to perform and process financial transactions.
With so many different types of systems to secure across every conceivable industry and sector,
it is critical that cybersecurity professionals from all corners of the field can
communicate effectively and succinctly. When it comes to cybersecurity threats,
just like in the real world, every second lost to an active attack incurs a
financial cost upwards of $22,000 per minute<sup>[\[1\]][1]</sup>. When every second matters,
it is critical that cybersecurity professionals and the organizations they are
supporting dedicate their time to defending and recovering from cyberattacks instead of
talking past each other everyone is using slightly different terminology.

Two common terms that show up when discussing cybersecurity and attacks are
***Exploit*** and ***Vulnerability***.
The two are nearly inseparable when talking
about security, but, nevertheless, it is important to separate them and avoid
confusing the two.


## Vulnerability
There's plenty of ways to define vulnerability in the scope of cybersecurity,
but we'll use RFC4949 as a reference for our purposes. The RFC defines
a vulnerability as follows:
>A flaw or weakness in a system's design, implementation, or operation and
management that could be exploited to violate the system's security policy.
<sup>[\[2\]][2]</sup>

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in a system. In the cybersecurity realm, these
are typically specifically in software and hardware.

### Finding Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities can be discovered by accident or by performing vulnerability
research or vulnerability analysis. Vulnerability Research and Vulnerability
Analysis involve actively looking for weaknesses in hardware and software using
whatever means are available. This could be as simple as trying to force a program
to terminate by sending it too many keystrokes too quickly, or it could be more
sophisticated and involve having to force a spike in voltage across an electronic
component to achieve an unintended effect.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

When vulnerabilities are discovered, they can either be reported or kept secret.
There will certainly be another post on various reporting procedures.
Vulnerabilities that are reported to software and hardware vendors can be fixed
or *patched*. A patch is one type of mitigation that can be put in place to fix
a vulnerability. Some patches might need to be installed with more urgency
than others. This urgency is tied to the severity of the vulnerability.

### Classifying Vulnerabilities
When some vulnerabilities are more severe than others, it is important to have
a way to somehow compare vulnerabilities.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)[\[3\]][3] provides a standardized
approach to assigning a numerical value to a vulnerability based on a number of
characteristics and details of the vulnerability itself. Vulnerabilities are
scored from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most critical and 0 being a no-risk
vulnerability.

If a software vendor releases a patch for a vulnerability with a CVSS score of 1,
that may require less immediate patching than if a fix for a vulnerability with a
CVSS score of 9 was released.

## Exploit
Vulnerabilities and exploits are inextricably linked together as exploits cannot exist
without vulnerabilities.
An exploit uses a vulnerability to achieve a specific goal.
More importantly, an exploit cannot exist without a vulnerability.

The most common goal for an exploit is to achieve remote code execution (RCE).
A RCE exploit allows an attacker to use a vulnerability to force a
software application to execute instructions that they provide.

The risk of an exploit is directly linked to the risk of the vulnerability
associated with it. For example, an exploiting a vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9
could allow a bad actor to force a system to execute malicious code with very little
skill on the part of the attacker.

### Going from Vulnerability to Exploit
For example, consider the a vulnerability found in Apple's FaceTime application
on iOS and macOS systems from February of 2019 ([CVE-2019-6223][4]). This was a
vulnerability with a CVSS score of 7.5, considered a high risk vulnerability.
FaceTime is a built-in application that comes with iOS, iPadOS, and macOS which allows
users to make video calls to other FaceTime users <sup>[\[5\]][5]</sup>.
The expected flow of making a FaceTime call is the caller must use the FaceTime
application to contact another party. The phone will ring for the other party
and they have the option to either accept or decline the call.
The vulnerability that was disclosed in 2019 was a logic flaw that did not properly track the state of participants in a group FaceTime session.

This vulnerability can readily be turned into an exploit allowing a bad actor to
surreptitiously record audio and video from an unsuspecting FaceTime user.
Suppose there are FaceTime users, Bob and Mallory. Mallory wants to find out
what Bob is doing without Bob noticing, so she exploits the vulnerability described
above.

The vulnerability itself was trivial to exploit.
Mallory calls Bob via FaceTime and Bob must answer the call in order for the two
to communicate. The vulnerability in this case allowed Mallory to convert the
one-on-one conversation into a group conversation by adding herself as an
additional participant in the conversation. Due to a logic flaw in FaceTime,
this would cause Bob's device to automatically answer the call, enabling Bob's
microphone and camera.

## Defending Against Vulnerabilities and Exploits
Vulnerabilities are like secret passages. They can potentially remain hidden
forever, but once discovered, they can become a weakness in your system. One
unmitigated vulnerability is all it can take to compromise an entire system.
The easiest thing for a user to do, is to make sure none of the known vulnerabilities
can be used to against them. It really is simple advice, keep systems up-to-date.
As soon as a software vendor has released a security update all the information
an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability on an unpatched system becomes
available.

vulnerabilities, ways to avoid introducing vulnerabilities, and plenty of other
