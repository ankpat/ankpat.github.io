# Exploit vs Vulnerability
***Exploit*** and ***vulnerability*** are nearly inseparable terms when discussing
the latest cyberattack. While it may seem like they can be used interchangeably,
it is important to understand that they are two distinct sides of the same coin.
**An exploit cannot exist without a vulnerability.**

**Vulnerability:**
A weakness in a system's design or
implementation<sup>[\[1\]][1]</sup>.
For our purposes, we will restrict the definition specifically to software.

**Exploit:**
The use of a vulnerability to violate a system's security policy.

A vulnerability in a real-world situation could be that maintenance personnel
are allowed free movement around special events such as the Super Bowl with
little intervention by security personnel.
An exploit of this vulnerability could be walking through the side entrance to
a sports venue carrying a toolbox and a ladder, unquestioned by security
personnel as a group of individual claims they did in 2017.

## Vulnerability

### Where do They Come From?
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses, and weaknesses are bad.
How do they come about and why isn't more being done to prevent them?

Well, turns out that vulnerabilities are hard to avoid, despite the best efforts
by programmers and the tools they use.
Software vulnerabilities come from defects in the underlying code. These
defects can be extremely subtle but can turn into vulnerabilities.
Defects can be introduced by human error or can arise from emergent behavior in
a complex software system.
For example, a human could introduce a logic error in software accidentally which
could then become a vulnerability given specific inputs to the software system.

Complex software often performs several operations simultaneously. This can lead
to situations where the logic is sound for each individual operation but can
break down when multiple operations are happening at once. These types of
vulnerabilities are particularly interesting and will be the focus of another post.

### How to Find Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities can be discovered by accident or intentionally by performing vulnerability
research or vulnerability analysis. Vulnerability research and vulnerability
analysis involve actively looking for weaknesses using
whatever means are available. This could be as simple as trying to force a program
to terminate by sending it too many keystrokes too quickly, or it could be more
sophisticated and involve having to force a spike in voltage across an electronic
component to achieve an unintended effect.

### How to Compare Vulnerabilities
When some vulnerabilities are more severe than others, it is important to have
a way to somehow compare vulnerabilities.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)<sup>[\[2\]][2]</sup> provides a standardized
approach to assigning a numerical value to a vulnerability based on a number of
characteristics and details of the vulnerability itself. Vulnerabilities are
scored from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most critical and 0 being a no-risk
vulnerability.

## Exploit
An exploit uses a vulnerability to achieve a specific goal.

In order to demonstrate the severity of a vulnerability, security researchers
develop Proof-of-Concept (PoC) tools that prove a vulnerability is exploitable.

The risk of an exploit is directly linked to the risk of the vulnerability
associated with it. For example, an exploiting a vulnerability with a CVSS score of 9
could allow a bad actor to force a system to execute malicious code with very little
skill on the part of the attacker.

### Going from Vulnerability to Exploit
To highlight the difference between a vulnerability and an exploit and to show
how a vulnerability can be turned into an exploit, let's take a look at a
peculiar vulnerability from 2019 affecting iOS and macOS devices.<sup>[\[3\]][3]</sup>
FaceTime is a built-in application that comes with iOS, iPadOS, and macOS which allows
users to make video calls to other FaceTime users.<sup>[\[4\]][4]</sup>
The expected flow of making a FaceTime call is the caller must use the FaceTime
application to contact another party. The phone will ring for the other party
and they have the option to either accept or decline the call.

This vulnerability did not properly track the state of participants in a group
FaceTime session and carried a CVSS score of 7.5, making it a high-risk vulnerability.

Exploitation of this vulnerability turned out to be quite trivial. Suppose
Eve wants to eavesdrop on Alice without Alice knowing.
1. Eve calls Alice via FaceTime and Alice must answer the call in order for the two
to communicate.
2. Eve adds herself as an additional participant to the conversation, converting
the session to a group conversation.
3. Alice's device automatically accepts the call from Eve, activating Alice's
microphone and camera.
4. Eve has now exploited the vulnerability to eavesdrop on Alice.

## Defending Against Vulnerabilities and Exploits
The above vulnerability was fixed, or *patched*, by Apple in iOS 12.1.4. In order
for users to protect themselves from being exploited, they had to install the update
on their vulnerable devices.

Vulnerabilities are like secret passages. They can potentially remain hidden
forever, but once discovered, they can become a weakness in a system. One
unmitigated vulnerability could be all it can take to compromise an entire system.
The easiest thing for a user to do is to make sure none of the known vulnerabilities
can be used to against them. It really is simple advice, ***keep systems up-to-date***.
As soon as a software vendor has released a security update all the information
an attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability on an unpatched system becomes
available. This may not always be possible and there are many bad actors that will
try to use low-hanging fruit to gain access to systems and networks.
